# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-07)

**Core value:** Media, made durable.
**Current focus:** No active milestone
Milestone `v1.7` is shipped and archived. The next operator action is to open
the next milestone with `/gsd-new-milestone`.

## Current Position

Phase: Post-close handoff (`v1.7`) — COMPLETE
Plan: Start the next milestone when scope is ready
Status: Phases 37-41 complete; milestone archived
Last activity: 2026-05-08 -- v1.7 archived and tagged for release closure

## Recent Completion

- Last completed milestone: `v1.7 GCS Resumable Adapter`
- Scope: Phases 37-41, 17 plans, 18/18 reqs validated
- Tag: `v1.7` (milestone close tag)
- Archive files:
  - `.planning/milestones/v1.7-ROADMAP.md`
  - `.planning/milestones/v1.7-REQUIREMENTS.md`
  - `.planning/milestones/v1.7-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`
  - `.planning/milestones/v1.7-phases/` (Phases 37-41 artifacts)
  - `.planning/milestones/v1.6-ROADMAP.md`
  - `.planning/milestones/v1.6-REQUIREMENTS.md`
  - `.planning/milestones/v1.6-phases/` (Phases 33-36 artifacts)

## Pending Todos

- Phase 34/35 code-review polish — advisory Warning/Info findings deferred
  from v1.6 close. Either auto-fix early in v1.7 via `/gsd-code-review N --fix`
  or defer to v1.8.

- Preserve tus protocol candidate (`v1.6-CANDIDATE-TUS.md`, 6/10) as locked
  v1.8 scope.

- Preserve Phase 37-style pull-forward of browser→Mux direct creator upload
  (MUX-20..23, ~1 day, LOW risk) as v1.8+ candidate.

## Blockers/Concerns

- None. v1.4/v1.5 phase-directory reconciliation completed in commit b09b1c9
  (archived to `.planning/milestones/v1.4-phases/` and `v1.5-phases/`).

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred at v1.6 milestone close on 2026-05-07:

| Category | Item | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| uat | Phase 36 — `bash scripts/install_smoke.sh mux` cassette PR run | pending (CI-only by Plan 03 design) |
| uat | Phase 36 — `mux-soak` real-Mux lane against `streaming`-labelled PR | pending (requires 5 GitHub Secrets) |
| uat | Phase 36 — HexDocs publish wire (`mix docs` rendering of MuxWeb + streaming_providers.md) | pending (post-publish observable) |
| uat | Phase 36 — Fork-secret leak boundary on `streaming`-labelled fork PR | pending (GitHub fork secret semantics) |
| uat | Phase 36 — `Rindle.InstallSmoke.GeneratedAppSmokeMuxTest` in spawned Phoenix project | pending (CI package-consumer step only) |
| code-review | Phase 34 — 9 Warning + 3 Info findings in `34-REVIEW.md` | deferred to v1.7 polish |
| code-review | Phase 35 — 6 Warning + 7 Info findings (advisory) | deferred to v1.7 polish |

Phase 36 verifier passed 5/5 must-haves at artifact-and-wiring level; the
5 UAT items above are CI-time observables by design (Plan 03 SUMMARY
explicitly defers them to the package-consumer CI step).

Phase 36 code-review findings — **all 12 already resolved before close**
(commits `8b291c1` CR-01, `744755e` CR-02, `12dfd0f` CR-03, `a1e5e94`–`c901124`
WR-01..WR-10). REVIEW.md `status: fixes_applied`. No Phase 36 review
deferral remains.

## Decision-Making Preference

- Downstream agents should front-load research, use subagents when helpful,
  prefer coherent one-shot recommendation sets, and decide by default rather
  than escalating routine design choices.

- Recommendation sets should be ecosystem-aware and internally coherent:
  prefer idiomatic Elixir/Phoenix/Ecto/Plug patterns for this kind of
  library, check successful peer libraries/apps for lessons and footguns,
  and synthesize a single cohesive direction instead of presenting loosely
  related options back to the user.

- Shift this preference left: front-load research, use subagents when helpful,
  and default to one-shot recommendation sets that let planning/execution
  proceed without reopening routine design choices.

- Default toward least-surprise public contracts, strong developer
  ergonomics, and operator-friendly behaviour. When a choice is advisory
  rather than truly blocking, prefer telemetry/docs/metadata over expanding
  the returned error surface.

- Escalate only for genuinely high-blast-radius decisions such as public
  semver reshapes, destructive or irreversible operations,
  security/compliance boundaries, real-cost surprises, or milestone/scope
  reshapes.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-05-07T15:34:36.918Z
v1.7 GCS Resumable Adapter started via `/gsd-new-milestone`; v1.7
REQUIREMENTS.md and ROADMAP.md written (5 phases, 18 plans, 18 reqs,
100% coverage).

**Last Completed Milestone:** v1.7 (Phases 37-41) — archived 2026-05-08,
tag `v1.7`.

**Next Step:** `/gsd-new-milestone` (define the next milestone and write fresh
requirements).

## Operator Next Steps

- Start the next milestone with `/gsd-new-milestone`.
