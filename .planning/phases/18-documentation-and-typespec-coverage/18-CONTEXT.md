# Phase 18: Documentation and Typespec Coverage - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-04-30 (assumptions mode + 3 parallel research subagents on callback enforcement, plan slicing, and ecosystem cross-validation)
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Land full `@doc` and `@spec` coverage on the locked public surface from Phase 17, replace opaque return types with named schema/result types so Dialyzer and ExDoc both teach adopters the real contract, and gate coverage in CI via `mix doctor --raise` so future drift fails the build.

This phase does **not** expand the public surface (Phase 17 owns that), does **not** rename anything published on `0.1.x` (semver posture from Phase 17 D-08 stands), and does **not** introduce new convenience helpers (those land in Phase 19). It documents what exists.

## Implementation Decisions

### Public surface scope (carried from Phase 17 D-03/D-04/D-06)

- **D-01:** Phase 18 documents only the intentionally public modules locked in `.planning/phases/17-api-surface-boundary-audit/17-CONTEXT.md`. Internal modules already hidden via `@moduledoc false` (D-05 there) stay out of scope. The public set: `Rindle`, `Rindle.Profile`, `Rindle.Upload.Broker`, `Rindle.Delivery`, `Rindle.Storage` + `Local`/`S3`, the four extension behaviours (`Authorizer`/`Analyzer`/`Scanner`/`Processor`), `Rindle.LiveView`, `Rindle.HTML`, all `Mix.Tasks.Rindle.*`, `Rindle.Workers.AbortIncompleteUploads`, `Rindle.Workers.CleanupOrphans`, and the five `Rindle.Domain.*` schema modules.
- **D-02:** Coverage starting state (verified by direct grep on the codebase): `Rindle` facade + `Rindle.Delivery` + all five `Rindle.Domain.*` schemas are already complete on `@doc`/`@spec`/`@type t`. Largest gaps: `Rindle.Upload.Broker` has `@doc` on every public function but **zero `@spec`**; the four extension behaviours plus `Rindle.Storage` have `@callback`s without per-callback `@doc`; all five `Mix.Tasks.Rindle.*` lack any `@spec`; both cron workers lack `@doc`/`@spec` on `perform/1`; `Rindle.HTML.picture_tag/3` lacks `@doc`; `Rindle.Profile.__using__/1` macro lacks `@doc`/`@spec`.

### Named struct types (API-07)

- **D-03:** Replace opaque `{:ok, map()}` / `{:ok, struct()}` / `{:ok, term()}` returns in `Rindle` and `Rindle.Upload.Broker` public `@spec`s with named schema types — `{:ok, MediaAsset.t()}`, `{:ok, MediaUploadSession.t()}`, `{:ok, MediaAttachment.t()}`, etc. This matches `Ecto.Repo.insert/2`'s spec shape (`{:ok, Ecto.Schema.t()} | {:error, Ecto.Changeset.t()}`) — adopters dispatch through the schema-aware facade and deserve schema-aware specs.
- **D-04:** Define behaviour-level named result types on `Rindle.Storage`: `@type put_result :: %{key: String.t(), ...}`, `@type delete_result :: ...`, `@type url_result :: ...`. Adapter callbacks (`Rindle.Storage.S3`, `Rindle.Storage.Local`) spec to those behaviour-defined types via `@impl true`. This is the `Tesla.Adapter` / `Ecto.Adapter.Schema` pattern — heterogeneous adapter return shapes converge at the behaviour, not at the call site. Per-adapter `t/0` types are the wrong unit because callers dispatch dynamically.
- **D-05:** Multi-key public result maps (`%{session: MediaUploadSession.t(), asset: MediaAsset.t()}` returned by `verify_completion/2`; `%{session: ..., presigned: %{url: ..., method: ..., headers: ...}}` returned by multipart helpers) get named `@type` aliases at the module level (e.g. `@type verify_result :: %{...}`) and are referenced by name in the function `@spec`. Inline anonymous map types in `@spec` make ExDoc unreadable — naming them is the Phoenix/Ecto convention for any multi-key result.

### `mix doctor` configuration

- **D-06:** Add `{:doctor, "~> 0.22.0", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false}` to `mix.exs` deps. Generate initial `.doctor.exs` via `mix doctor.gen.config` to baseline current-state thresholds (Plan 18-01), then ratchet to final values in Plan 18-05.
- **D-07:** Final `.doctor.exs` thresholds (locked target — landing in Plan 18-05): `min_module_doc_coverage: 100`, `min_overall_doc_coverage: 100`, `min_overall_moduledoc_coverage: 100` for the documentation side; `min_module_spec_coverage: 95`, `min_overall_spec_coverage: 95` for the spec side. Spec thresholds at 95 (not 100) accept the `@impl true` callback-inheritance pattern that Ecto, Phoenix, Hex, and Elixir core all use for Mix tasks (`run/1`) and Oban workers (`perform/1`) — see D-12 / D-13. This matches `prom_ex`'s threshold set (90/90/90/90/100) one notch stricter; significantly stricter than the Ash family (40/0/50/0/100) without forcing per-module exemptions for callback-implementing modules.
- **D-08:** `mix doctor` does **not** auto-skip `@moduledoc false` modules ([open issue #67](https://github.com/akoutmos/doctor/issues/67) — confirmed by reading `lib/cli/cli.ex` source). The `.doctor.exs` `ignore_modules:` list MUST explicitly cover every internal hidden by Phase 17 D-05. Use the Ash-family idiom: lead with conventional regexes (`~r/^Inspect\./` for protocol implementations), then a `~r/^Rindle\..*\.Internal\./`-style namespace regex for any Phase-17 hidden modules that share a namespace prefix, then an explicit list for the rest with a comment explaining each. Real-world precedents: `ash_authentication`, `cinder`, `pgflow`, `jido` all use this shape.
- **D-09:** Doctor's `--raise` flag is belt-and-suspenders in 0.22.0 — the task's `System.at_exit` hook already exits non-zero on failure (verified by reading `lib/mix/tasks/doctor.ex`), but `--raise` produces a louder Mix.raise error message. CI invocation is `mix doctor --full --raise`. `--full` (not `--summary`) gives a per-module table on failure, which is far more useful in CI logs than a one-liner. Matches `team-alembic/staple-actions/actions/mix-doctor` and `buildkite/test_collector_elixir`.

### CI integration

- **D-10:** Add the doctor step to the `quality` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` between `Credo (strict)` (line 84-85) and `Run tests with coverage` (line 87-88). Run as `MIX_ENV=test mix doctor --full --raise`. `MIX_ENV=test` is **required**: `Rindle.LiveView` and `Rindle.HTML` are wrapped in `if Code.ensure_loaded?(...)` because their `phoenix_live_view` / `phoenix_html` deps are `optional: true`; in `:dev` env those modules don't exist and doctor would silently skip them. Test env loads them via the test-suite's transitive deps. Runs on both Elixir 1.15 and 1.17 matrix lanes. No `continue-on-error` — failure blocks merge same as credo and dialyzer.

### Documentation patterns by module type

- **D-11:** Behaviour modules (`Rindle.Storage`, `Rindle.Authorizer`, `Rindle.Analyzer`, `Rindle.Scanner`, `Rindle.Processor`) — place `@doc """..."""` **immediately preceding** every `@callback` declaration. This is the universal Elixir pattern (Phoenix.Endpoint, Ecto.Adapter.*, Oban.Worker, Tesla.Adapter, Plug.Session.Store, Broadway.Producer all do exactly this). For callbacks introduced after `0.1.0`, optionally annotate with `@doc since: "0.x.y"` (Broadway / Oban convention). Adapter implementations (`Storage.Local`, `Storage.S3`) use `@impl Rindle.Storage` and inherit docs from the behaviour — do not duplicate `@doc` on `@impl` callback implementations.
- **D-12:** Mix tasks (`Mix.Tasks.Rindle.*`) — use `@shortdoc` + `@moduledoc` + `@impl true` only. **Do NOT add `@doc` or `@spec` to `run/1`.** Verified across `Mix.Tasks.Ecto.Migrate`, `Mix.Tasks.Phx.New`, `Mix.Tasks.Hex.Publish`, and Elixir core's own `Mix.Tasks.Run` — none `@doc` or `@spec` their `run/1`. The `@impl true` is the documentation pointer to `Mix.Task.run/1`'s behaviour-defined contract. Doctor passes these via D-07's 95% spec threshold + `@impl` inheritance.
- **D-13:** Oban workers (`Rindle.Workers.AbortIncompleteUploads`, `Rindle.Workers.CleanupOrphans`) — invest in a rich `@moduledoc` (what the worker does, its scheduling cadence, observable telemetry, side effects). **Drop `@doc` from `perform/1`.** Add `@spec perform(Oban.Job.t()) :: ...` only if Rindle's worker narrows the return type beyond `Oban.Worker.result()`. This matches the Plausible production pattern and avoids duplicating `Oban.Worker`'s behaviour-level docs.
- **D-14:** `Rindle.Profile.__using__/1` — keep `@doc` directly above `defmacro __using__(opts)` describing the `use Rindle.Profile` API contract (the Phoenix.Controller / Phoenix.LiveView pattern). Use `@spec __using__(keyword()) :: Macro.t()` (the `thousand_island` / `ash_reactor` pattern). This avoids needing an `ignore_modules:` exemption for `Rindle.Profile`.
- **D-15:** `Rindle.HTML.picture_tag/3` — add `@doc """..."""` describing the helper's purpose, options, and example output. The function already has `@spec`.

### Compatibility shim documentation

- **D-16:** `Rindle.log_variant_processing_failure/3` (the Phase 17 D-12 hidden facade shim) gets the **Phoenix.Controller compatibility-shim shape**: `@doc false` + `@deprecated "Use ..."` + existing `@spec`. The `@deprecated` attribute makes the compiler emit a deprecation warning to any caller still depending on the old function — strictly stronger guarantee than `@doc false` alone, and free. Confirmed `@doc false` exempts the function from doctor's `@doc` coverage but counts it toward `@spec` coverage (verified by reading doctor's `lib/module_report.ex`). Concrete deprecation message text is at the implementer's discretion (Claude's Discretion below).
- **D-17:** `Rindle.verify_upload/2` (the Phase 17 D-09 / D-11 legacy public name kept for `0.1.x` compatibility) keeps its current visible `@doc` + `@doc deprecated: "Use verify_completion/2"` metadata. This is the Ecto.Repo.transaction/2 pattern (`@doc deprecated: "Use Repo.transact/2"`) — visible in ExDoc, soft-deprecation warning at compile time. Distinct from D-16's hidden shim.

### Callback documentation enforcement

- **D-18:** Adopt **honor-system** enforcement for `@doc` on `@callback` declarations. Doctor does not analyze callback declarations at all (verified by reading `lib/module_information.ex`); ExDoc `--warnings-as-errors` does not catch missing callback docs either. **Do NOT** build a custom Credo check. Every reference Elixir lib in this space (Ecto.Adapter, Oban.Worker, Phoenix.Channel, Phoenix.Endpoint, Plug.Session.Store, Tesla.Adapter, Broadway.Producer, Membrane.Source) relies on the convention plus code review and ships zero callback-doc enforcement tooling. Building one would make Rindle the first.
- **D-19:** Add a low-cost ExUnit backstop test (`test/rindle/behaviour_docs_test.exs`, ~15 LOC) that uses `Code.fetch_docs/1` on each behaviour module's compiled BEAM and asserts every `:callback` doc is neither `:none` nor `:hidden`. This is ecosystem-idiomatic (uses public Elixir API, the same one ExDoc uses), maintenance-free across Credo upgrades, and gives identical CI-time feedback as a custom Credo check at a fraction of the cost. Lives in the test suite, runs as part of the existing `mix test` step, no new tooling.
- **D-20:** Add a single line to `CONTRIBUTING.md` (or `README.md`'s contributing section if no `CONTRIBUTING.md` exists) documenting the convention: "Every public `@callback` must be preceded by `@doc \"\"\"...\"\"\"`. Use `@doc false` only for internal compatibility shims." Single line, zero ceremony.
- **D-21:** Optional DX add-on (lower priority; agent's discretion to include in Phase 18 or defer): adopt a Membrane-style `@moduledoc` callback summary on each of the five behaviour modules — a brief list of callbacks at the top of `@moduledoc` so adopters see the contract surface in the first ExDoc panel before scrolling. Hand-written is fine at five behaviours.

### Plan slicing (5 plans, baseline-then-ratchet)

- **D-22:** Phase 18 ships as **5 plans** mirroring Phase 17's RED-harness-first rhythm but with one critical refinement. Plan 18-01 lands `:doctor` with thresholds **at current-state baseline** (generated by `mix doctor.gen.config`), NOT at the final 100/95 target. Plan 18-05 ratchets to the final thresholds. Rationale: Sorbet's adoption playbook at Shopify and the Notion ESLint ratcheting pattern both warn that introducing a static-analysis tool with thresholds set at the *target* state blocks unrelated PRs and creates desensitization noise. The Phase 17 P01 RED-only worked because its window was 7 minutes; if Phase 18's plan 1 → plan 5 spans days, that approach backfires. Baseline-then-ratchet keeps the failing-test discipline (a unit test asserts the *target* thresholds — see D-23) without making CI itself the failing harness.
- **D-23:** Plan 18-01 ships a failing ExUnit test (`test/rindle/doctor_thresholds_test.exs`) that reads `.doctor.exs` and asserts the configured thresholds equal the target values from D-07. This test fails at plan 1 (because plan 1 ships baseline thresholds, not target). It turns green at plan 18-05 when thresholds ratchet up. RED-only commit lives in plan 1; the failing test is the harness, not the CI gate. Same TDD invariant as Phase 17 P01, different surface.
- **D-24:** Locked plan order:
  1. **18-01 — Failing harness + baseline doctor:** add `:doctor` dep, run `mix doctor.gen.config`, commit `.doctor.exs` with current-state thresholds, add `MIX_ENV=test mix doctor --full --raise` step to CI's `quality` job, write the failing `doctor_thresholds_test.exs` asserting target. CI passes (because thresholds match current state); test fails (because thresholds don't yet equal target). RED-only commit.
  2. **18-02 — Named-types tightening:** D-03 / D-04 / D-05 — replace opaque returns in `Rindle` and `Rindle.Upload.Broker` with `MediaAsset.t()` etc.; define `Rindle.Storage` behaviour result types and adapter `@impl` references; name multi-key result aliases.
  3. **18-03 — Behaviours + Broker:** D-11 — add per-`@callback` `@doc` to all five behaviour modules; add the missing `@spec`s on every public function in `Rindle.Upload.Broker`; add the D-19 backstop test.
  4. **18-04 — Ops, integrations, macro, and shims:** D-12 (Mix tasks `@moduledoc`/`@shortdoc`/`@impl` posture), D-13 (worker `@moduledoc` enrichment, drop `@doc` from `perform/1`), D-14 (`Rindle.Profile.__using__/1` doc + spec), D-15 (`Rindle.HTML.picture_tag/3` doc), D-16 (compatibility shim `@deprecated` annotation), and the D-20 CONTRIBUTING note.
  5. **18-05 — Closure / ratchet:** ratchet `.doctor.exs` thresholds from baseline to target (D-07), turn the D-23 failing test green, add CHANGELOG entry summarizing the doc/spec sweep, run `mix doctor --full` locally + CI green, optional D-21 callback summaries.
- **D-25:** **Defensive split clause:** if at planning time the file count for plan 18-04 exceeds 10 files, split it into 18-04a (Mix tasks only) and 18-04b (workers, integrations, macro, compatibility shims). Phase 17's average plan size was ~10 files (P02: 15, P03: 12, P05: 13); 18-04 should stay in that range.

### Decision-making preference (carried)

- **D-26:** Continue the project's existing GSD preference (saved feedback memory + STATE.md "Decision-Making Preference" block): the agent decides by default with deep subagent research and locked recommendations; escalate only for VERY impactful items (public API / module / function renames touching the published surface, semver-affecting changes, deletion of git history or hex versions, secret/auth scope changes, cost-bearing infra, milestone/scope reshape). Phase 18 has zero such items — every decision above is mechanical and recoverable.

### Claude's Discretion

- Exact `.doctor.exs` baseline numbers (Plan 18-01 captures these via `mix doctor.gen.config` rather than hand-rolling).
- Exact wording of the `@deprecated` message on `Rindle.log_variant_processing_failure/3` (D-16) and any other shim added later.
- Exact phrasing of the `@moduledoc` on each behaviour and the optional D-21 callback summaries.
- Whether the D-21 Membrane-style callback summaries land in Plan 18-05 (closure) or get deferred to a later DX-polish phase. Default: include in 18-05 if the closure plan stays small; defer otherwise.
- Whether the D-20 CONTRIBUTING line lands in 18-04 or a separate small commit.
- Exact regex composition in `.doctor.exs` `ignore_modules:` — the **list** of modules to ignore is fully specified by Phase 17 D-05; the **regex shape** (e.g. `~r/^Rindle\.Security\./` vs explicit list) is at the planner's discretion.
- Naming of the `Rindle.Storage` behaviour-level result types (`put_result` / `delete_result` / `url_result` are placeholders; `Rindle.Storage.put_result/0` or `Rindle.Storage.put/0` style is fine).
- Whether to set `failed: true` in `.doctor.exs` (cosmetic — filters output to failing modules; does not affect exit code).
- Whether to add `mix docs --warnings-as-errors` as a complementary CI step in 18-01 (research found this catches autolink/extras issues but NOT missing `@callback` docs; modest DX value, ~1 line of CI config).

## Existing Code Insights

### Reusable Assets
- `Rindle` facade and `Rindle.Delivery` are already exemplar — every public function has `@doc` + `@spec`. Use them as the template for what "complete" looks like in Plans 18-02 / 18-03 / 18-04.
- All five `Rindle.Domain.*` schemas already define `@type t :: %__MODULE__{}` and `@spec changeset/2`. The named-type work in Plan 18-02 / D-03 is consuming these existing types from the facade and broker — not creating new ones.
- `mix.exs` already has the right deps shape (`{:credo, "~> 1.7", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false}`) so `:doctor` lands in the same convention without disrupting anything.
- The Phase 17 `groups_for_modules` ExDoc configuration is correct as-is — Phase 18 doesn't change module visibility, only adds `@doc`/`@spec` to already-visible modules.
- The CI `quality` job (lines 78-107 of `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) already runs across an Elixir 1.15 + 1.17 matrix — the new doctor step inherits that matrix coverage for free.

### Established Patterns
- Phase 17 used the **failing-harness-first** rhythm successfully (17-01 was RED-only). Phase 18 mirrors it but with the harness as a unit test rather than a CI gate (D-22 / D-23) — the CI gate ships passing from day one with baseline thresholds, the failing test asserts the target.
- Project conventions are stable: `@spec` types use named types (Ecto pattern), telemetry is the observability primary (per Phase 17 D-13), `@moduledoc false` is the boundary marker (per Phase 17 D-05/D-07).
- `@impl` annotations are used consistently in adapter implementations, which means D-12 (Mix tasks) and D-13 (Oban workers) plug in cleanly without retrofitting `@impl` discipline.

### Integration Points
- `mix.exs` deps list — Plan 18-01 adds the `:doctor` line.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` `quality` job — Plan 18-01 adds the `mix doctor --full --raise` step.
- New file: `.doctor.exs` at project root — Plan 18-01 generates baseline; Plan 18-05 ratchets to target.
- New file: `test/rindle/doctor_thresholds_test.exs` — Plan 18-01 ships failing test; Plan 18-05 turns green.
- New file: `test/rindle/behaviour_docs_test.exs` — Plan 18-03 ships D-19 backstop using `Code.fetch_docs/1`.
- Optional: `CONTRIBUTING.md` (or new section in `README.md`) — Plan 18-04 / D-20 adds the single-line callback-doc convention.
- Updated: every public module from D-01 list across plans 18-02, 18-03, 18-04 — see plan order in D-24.

## Specific Ideas

- Prefer the term **"named result type"** over "named struct type" in planning and ExDoc prose, because not every result is a struct — some are multi-key result maps with named `@type` aliases (D-05). "Named struct type" comes from API-07's wording but the implementation is broader.
- When tightening `@spec` returns in Plan 18-02, retain `{:error, term()}` (or `{:error, atom()}` where the error vocabulary is fully enumerated) on the error branch — narrowing the error term is a Dialyzer-breaking change for any adopter pattern-matching on it, and `0.1.x` semver posture (Phase 17 D-08) blocks that.
- For the optional D-21 Membrane-style callback summary, prefer hand-written summaries over a macro-driven approach. Five behaviours × ~3 callbacks each is small enough; introducing a `DocsHelper` macro for ~15 callback names is over-engineering at this scale.
- When writing the `@deprecated "..."` attribute (D-16), keep the message terse and actionable in the Phoenix.Controller idiom — e.g. `@deprecated "Use Rindle.Internal.VariantFailureLogger.log/3 instead — this facade shim is kept for 0.1.x compatibility only"`. Adopters see this at compile time; brevity matters.
- The D-23 failing-test contract is intentionally narrow: it reads `.doctor.exs` and asserts `min_module_doc_coverage == 100`, etc. against the values from D-07. Don't over-design — three or four assertions is enough. The test is a failing harness, not a doctor reimplementation.

## Deferred Ideas

- **Stricter callback-doc enforcement** (custom Credo check or Elixir-side static check beyond the D-19 ExUnit backstop) — defer until ecosystem demand or actual drift incidents emerge. Rindle's behaviour count (5 modules, ~10 callbacks) is too small to justify novel tooling.
- **`mix docs --warnings-as-errors`** as a complementary CI step — research found this catches autolink/extras-link issues but NOT missing `@callback` docs. Modest DX value; defer to Phase 19 or later if extras/guides churn warrants it.
- **Per-module `min_module_*` overrides** in `.doctor.exs` — defer until D-07's strict 100/95 thresholds prove problematic in practice. If a specific module needs lower thresholds, address in a focused fix-up rather than baking exemptions into Phase 18.
- **`@doc since:` annotations on every existing callback** — D-11 keeps this optional and only for *new* callbacks introduced after `0.1.0`. Retroactive `@doc since: "0.1.0"` everywhere is noise. If versioning discipline becomes valuable later, address in a separate small phase.
- **`Rindle.Storage.Adapter` as a separate behaviour module** — D-04 places the result types directly on `Rindle.Storage`, which currently holds both adapter behaviour and dispatch logic. Splitting `Storage` from `Storage.Adapter` is a Phase 17-class boundary change and belongs to a future cleanup, not Phase 18.
- **Removing `Rindle.verify_upload/2` and `Rindle.log_variant_processing_failure/3` shims entirely** — Phase 17 D-11 / 17-CONTEXT deferred deferred ideas already; both compatibility shims live until `0.2.0` per the locked semver posture. Phase 18 only adds the `@deprecated` annotation (D-16) and keeps the existing `@doc deprecated:` metadata (D-17).
- **Membrane-style auto-injected callback list macro** — D-21 keeps the option of hand-written summaries; macro-driven generation is over-engineering for five behaviours but could become valuable if the behaviour count grows substantially.

### Reviewed Todos (not folded)
None — the two pending todos in STATE.md (`Plan GCS adapter resumable upload flow (GCS-01)`, `Evaluate tus/resumable protocol once release distribution is routine (TUS-01)`) are unrelated to documentation/typespec coverage and stay parked.
